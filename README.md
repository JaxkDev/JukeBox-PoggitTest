# JukeBox-pmmp

A small plugin that implements the Jukebox and Records untill its in the core of pmmp !

#### IMPORTANT INFO:
For this plugin to function as intended, all mobile device users must download the 90mb DLC 'Music' free from the store in game (It is a one time download).
__(Please do not make issues saying theres no sound, there is but you have to have the dlc)__

## Special Thanks:
_Thanks to the below for helping me testing in private, your help was massively appreciated._

## Known Issues:
- State being lost when server closed

## Whats Coming ?

[X] JukeBox block
[X] Record Items
[X] Sound playing
[X] Popup "Now Playing X"
[] Custom record names (so resource packs can modify the sound)
[] Save and Read state (when server restarts records remain in jukebox)
